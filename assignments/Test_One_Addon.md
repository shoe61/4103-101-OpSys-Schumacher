Due: Oct 18th by classtime.

For up to 15 points to be added to your exam, complete the following.

### Multi\*
Define the following and give examples of each.

1. Multi-tasking- 		Our text (p. 57) actually equates multiprogramming and multitasking: "The approach is known as 
						multiprogramming or multitasking." However, we have defined multitasking as a single processer
						switching contexts so rapidly that it appears the processes were running concurrently. Really,
						it's extremely rapid serial execution of slices of each process.
					
2. Multi-programming-	As noted above; Multiprogrammed batch systems have the advantage of increased processor utilization
						compared to uniprogrammed systems. Since any given process spends much of its time waiting for I/O,
						the processor can switch between processes without any penalty in speed. Multiprogramming relies on
						hardware that supports interrupts and DMA (p. 58).
						
3. Multi-processing-	Multiprocessing requires multiple processors or multiple cores. This is actual concurrent processing;
						multiple processes can be running simultaneously, each on a separate processor / core. 

4. Multi-threaded-		"Multithreading is a technique in which a process, executing an application, is divided into threads 
						that can run concurrently..." where  a thread is "... a dispatchable unit of work. It includes a 
						processor context... and its own data area... A thread executes sequentially and is interruptible so 
						that the processor can turn to another thread." (p. 70-71). Does not require multiple processors/cores.

### What to turn in:
- A markdown file that contains your answers in a structured format.
- Name your file: `Test_One_Addon.md`
- Thorough well thought out answers to the questions.
- Mardown reference: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
- This is to add a letter grade and a half to your exam, so I will be extremely picky.
